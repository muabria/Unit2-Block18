/*                      Shopping Cart Function Test
                         

             PseudoCode for 'Shopping Cart Function Test' : UNIT

    
        A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. 
        They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest.
    
        Think about the following; you may need to make assumptions or decisions about the prompt and how the feature should behave:

        - What should happen if the cart is empty?
        - What needs to be shown to the user at each step of check out?
        - What behaviors of this feature does the prompt miss or gloss over?

    Hint: Observe the shopping cart and checkout features of some popular websites to get some ideas!
